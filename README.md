# njson

A JSON parser and builder library for .Net.

This library is build for efficient parsing and generation of JSON strings for server based use cases. It is designed to be used for streaming JSON strings to and from network sockets and files without necessarily needing to create entire object graphs in memory or for cases when object graphs will not be mapped to complex types but will instead be modelled as list and dictionary structures.
